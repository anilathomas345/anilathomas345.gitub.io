            <p>Taste and See Coffee Shop and Gallery offers a unique coffee house environment 
                unlike any other in Macon. We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup 
                of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you can 
                sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. If you need to work, we have a seating
                area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating area in front
                of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body. We offer a delicious variety
                of coffee roasted in house made by our professionally trained baristas. We have everything
                from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages.  All of our sauces & syrups 
                are made in-house with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives)
                ensuring you the highest quality in taste & health.  You can complete your
                coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker.
                We look forward to serving you at Taste & See Coffee Shop and Gallery!</p>
